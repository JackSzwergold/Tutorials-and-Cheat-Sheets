## macOS - MAMP - MSSQL Module Items

By Jack Szwergold

### PHP MSSQL under MAMP 3.5.2 running PHP 5.6.10

Before anything else, make sure your local MAMP install’s binary paths are part of you default PATH. You would do this by adding the following paths to your main PATH in your `~/.bash_profile`:

* **MAMP 3.5.2 Main `bin/` Path**: `/Applications/MAMP/Library/bin`
* **MAMP 3.5.2 PHP `bin/` Path**: `/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.10/bin`

#### Compile and Install FreeTDS

We need to install FreeTDS within the installed version of MAMP.

Before anything else, make sure to head to your desktop before anything else happens:

	cd ~/Desktop

Now use Curl to grab the latest stable version of FreeTDS like this:

	curl -O -L ftp://ftp.freetds.org/pub/freetds/stable/freetds-patched.tar.gz

If the FTP connection fails, just use the HTTP equivalent:

	curl -O -L http://www.freetds.org/files/stable/freetds-patched.tar.gz

Then decompress the FreeTDS source code archive:

	tar -xf freetds-patched.tar.gz

Now go into the decompressed source code directory:

	cd freetds-*

And run this `configure` command:

	./configure --prefix=/Applications/MAMP/Library --with-tdsver=7.4 --sysconfdir=/Applications/MAMP/conf/freetds

With that done, run `make`:

	make

And finally install FreeTDS into the installed version of MAMP:

	make install

#### Compile PHP

Now we will download the exact same version of PHP you will be running under MAMP so we can properly compile the MSSQL module. We will not be completely rebuilding PHP from source, but we need the full PHP source code to build the module against.

Before anything else, make sure to head to your desktop before anything else happens:

	cd ~/Desktop

Now use Curl to grab the PHP source code for the version of PHP you will be using under MAMP like this:

	curl -O -L http://am1.php.net/distributions/php-5.6.10.tar.gz

Then decompress the PHP source code archive:

	tar -xf php-5.6.10.tar.gz

Now go into the decompressed source code directory:

	cd php-5.6.10

And run this `configure` command; we don’t need iconv for what we are doing so we build it like this:

	./configure --without-iconv

If for some reason you need iconv, you can run this `configure` command:

	./configure --with-iconv=/Applications/MAMP/Library/

And finally with that done, run `make`:

	make

#### Compiling the MSSQL Module

With PHP now compiled, let’s now go into the MSSQL PHP extension directory:

	cd ext/mssql

We’re going to run `phpize` to prepare the MSSQL PHP extension of compiling:

	phpize

Note if the `phpize` command fails with a bunch of `No such file or directory` errors like this:

	grep: /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.10/include/php/main/php.h: No such file or directory
	grep: /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.10/include/php/Zend/zend_modules.h: No such file or directory
	grep: /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.10/include/php/Zend/zend_extensions.h: No such file or directory
	Configuring for:
	PHP Api Version:        
	Zend Module Api No:     
	Zend Extension Api No:  

Then you need to create an `include/php` directory in this path:

	/Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.10/include/php

And the contents of that `include/php` directory will be the `php-5.6.10` source code directory itself. You might need to run `make clean` and run the configure commands in that directory again to get everything set. Then rerun `phpize` again and the output should be clean and look like this:

	Configuring for:
	PHP Api Version:         20131106
	Zend Module Api No:      20131226
	Zend Extension Api No:   220131226

With that done, run this `configure` command:

	./configure --with-mssql=/Applications/MAMP/Library

And finally with that done, run `make` to compile the MSSQL PHP extension:

	make

#### Installing the MSSQL Module

If that runs successfully you have now successfully created a `mssql.so` PHP module that has been compiled against `php-5.6.10` and is ready to use with MAMP.

Copy that module over into PHP version specific directory in MAMP like this:

	cp modules/mssql.so /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.10/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20131226/

Now adjust the PHP config file (`php.ini`) like this to get PHP to recognize it:

	sh -c "printf '\n[MSSQL]\nextension=mssql.so\n' >> /Applications/MAMP/bin/php/php5.6.10/conf/php.ini"

Now start MAMP again and check the output of the PHP info page and `mssql` should be clearly listed there under installed components.
